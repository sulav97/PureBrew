# üîç PureBrew Security Audit: The Deep Dive Report

> *"We didn't just test our security‚Äîwe tried to break it. Because the best way to protect something is to understand how it can be attacked."*

This isn't your typical security audit. We've gone beyond the standard checklist to conduct a comprehensive penetration testing and vulnerability assessment of PureBrew's security architecture. Every endpoint, every authentication mechanism, and every data flow has been examined through the lens of a potential attacker.

What we found might surprise you‚Äînot because of vulnerabilities, but because of the robust defenses we've built.
