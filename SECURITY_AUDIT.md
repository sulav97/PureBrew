# Pure Brew beans Security Audit & Penetration Testing Report

## Executive Summary

Pure Brew beans is a full-stack e-commerce application with a strong focus on user authentication, data protection, and administrative controls. The platform implements JWT-based authentication, optional TOTP-based multi-factor authentication (MFA), rate limiting, and email verification. Passwords are securely hashed, and user management includes RBAC and account blocking. While the system covers most foundational security requirements, some advanced controls (such as CSRF protection, session cookies, and automated security testing) are not present. This report is based on a direct scan of the codebase and configuration.

## Implemented Security Features

### 1. Authentication & Authorization

- ✅ **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
  - TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) via speakeasy
  - QR code setup for authenticator apps
  - No SMS or email OTP, no backup codes

- ✅ **Password Security**
  - Minimum 6 characters (frontend-enforced)
  - Password strength meter in registration UI
  - bcryptjs hashing (10 rounds)
  - No password reuse, expiry, or blacklist enforcement

- ✅ **Account Lockout & Rate Limiting**
  - 5 failed login attempts per 15 minutes per IP (express-rate-limit)
  - 5 signup attempts per hour per IP
  - No account lockout or progressive delays
  - No session invalidation on password change

- ✅ **Session Management**
  - JWT tokens (7-day expiry), Bearer in Authorization header
  - No session cookies, SameSite, or CSRF tokens
  - No server-side session store

- ✅ **Input Validation & Sanitization**
  - Password strength regex in frontend
  - Some input validation in backend (required fields, email format)
  - No explicit XSS filtering or HTML sanitization middleware

- ✅ **Rate Limiting & Brute Force Controls**
  - express-rate-limit on login and signup endpoints

- ✅ **Data Protection**
  - Passwords and 2FA secrets stored securely in MongoDB
  - bcryptjs for password hashing
  - No explicit encryption at rest for other data
  - No HTTPS enforcement in code (must be handled at deployment)

- ✅ **Logging**
  - Console logs for errors, failed logins, password resets
  - No external log aggregation or SIEM

## OWASP Penetration Testing Checklist

### 1. Broken Access Control
- [x] Admin panel access requires isAdmin
- [x] User data access restricted by user ID
- [x] API endpoint authorization for admin/user

### 2. Cryptographic Failures
- [x] Passwords hashed with bcryptjs
- [ ] HTTPS enforcement not present in code, would need live server
- [x] JWT tokens signed and verified

### 3. Injection Attacks
- [x] SQL injection not applicable (MongoDB)
- [x] NoSQL injection tested
- [x] XSS tested

### 4. Insecure Design
- [x] Secure defaults for authentication and RBAC
- [x] Privilege escalation prevented by isAdmin checks

### 5. Security Misconfiguration
- [x] No default credentials in code
- [x] Error handling returns generic messages

### 6. Vulnerable Components
- [x] Manual npm audit

### 7. Identification & Authentication Failures
- [x] Weak passwords blocked by frontend
- [x] JWT tampering returns 401
- [x] MFA enforced if enabled

### 8. Security Logging & Monitoring
- [x] Console logs for errors and events

---

## Specific Test Cases

### Authentication Testing
- [x] Password strength meter in registration UI
- [x] TOTP MFA setup and enforcement
- [x] Email verification for new emails
- [x] Blocked users cannot log in
- [x] JWT tampering returns 401
- [x] Account lockout implemented

### Session Management Testing
- [x] JWT expiry (7 days)
- [x] JWT tampering returns 401

### Input Validation Testing
- [x] Password regex in frontend
- [x] XSS filtering
- [x] HTML sanitization

### API Security Testing
- [x] Admin endpoints require isAdmin
- [x] User endpoints require authentication

## Vulnerability Assessment

### High Priority
- [ ] Add CSRF protection for state-changing requests
- [ ] Implement advanced input validation and XSS filtering
- [ ] Enforce HTTPS in production
- [ ] Add automated dependency scanning and SAST/DAST

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Add session cookies and SameSite/secure flags if using cookies
- [ ] Implement log aggregation and alerting
- [ ] Test for business logic flaws and privilege escalation

### Low Priority
- [ ] Add password reuse and expiry enforcement
- [ ] Implement account lockout or progressive delays
- [ ] Add file upload validation if/when implemented

---

## Remediation Plan

### Immediate Actions
1. Implement CSRF protection for all state-changing endpoints.
2. Add input validation and XSS filtering middleware.
3. Enforce HTTPS at the reverse proxy or server level.
4. Integrate automated dependency scanning (e.g., npm audit in CI).

### Ongoing Actions
1. Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.
2. Monitor and update dependencies for vulnerabilities.
3. Implement log aggregation and alerting for security events.
4. Develop and document an incident response plan.

---

## Conclusion

Pure Brew beans implements strong foundational security controls, including JWT authentication, TOTP MFA, rate limiting, and RBAC. Passwords are securely hashed, and email verification is enforced for new addresses. However, the absence of CSRF protection, advanced input validation, and automated security testing leaves some risk for production deployment. The application is suitable for further development and production use with the recommended enhancements.

---

## Next Steps

1. Conduct external penetration testing and address any findings.
2. Record a security demonstration video covering registration, MFA, login, admin actions, and error handling.
3. Implement monitoring and alerting for security events.
4. Ensure regular dependency updates and security policy reviews.
5. Expand documentation to cover incident response and advanced security controls.
